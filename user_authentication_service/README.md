User Authentication Service üöÄ

This project is a user authentication service built with Flask and SQLAlchemy. It provides a foundational backend system for handling user registration, login, session management, and password resets. The architecture emphasizes a clean separation of concerns, ensuring the web layer is decoupled from the database logic.

    How to retrieve and process request form data.

    How to use SQLAlchemy as an ORM to interact with a database.

    How to return appropriate HTTP status codes from an API.

    How to securely hash passwords and manage user credentials.
