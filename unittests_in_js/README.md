Unit Tests in JavaScriptThis project is a comprehensive introduction to unit and integration testing in a Node.js environment. The tasks within this project explore fundamental testing concepts and tools, building from basic test suites to more complex scenarios involving asynchronous operations, spies, stubs, and API integration testing.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this project, you will be able to explain and demonstrate:How to write a test suite using the Mocha test framework.How to use different assertion libraries like Node's built-in assert and Chai.How to structure and organize long or complex test suites.The concept of test doubles and when to use spies and stubs with Sinon.What hooks are (before, after, beforeEach, afterEach) and how to use them for setup and teardown.Techniques for testing asynchronous functions, including callbacks, Promises, and async/await.How to write integration tests for a small Node.js server built with Express.RequirementsNode.js: Version 20.x.x or laterOperating System: Ubuntu 20.04Editor: vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio CodeAll files must end with a new line.All code must use the .js extension.Installation & UsageClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd unittests_in_js
Install project dependencies:This will install Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and any other development dependencies listed in package.json.npm install
Run the tests:To run all tests for a specific task, use the npm test script followed by the path to the test file.# Example for running tests for task 0
npm test 0-calcul.test.js

# Example for running tests for task 1
npm test 1-calcul.test.js
The test command is configured in the package.json file to use the Mocha test runner.Core TechnologiesMocha: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha provides the foundational structure for our tests using describe() and it().Chai: A BDD / TDD assertion library for Node.js and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any JavaScript testing framework. We use Chai for its expressive and readable syntax (expect, should).Sinon.JS: A library for creating standalone test spies, stubs, and mocks for JavaScript. It is essential for isolating the code under test from its dependencies.Express: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for creating a simple API for our integration tests.This README file serves as the main entry point and documentation for the project.
