# Project: Asynchronous Python Programming

This project focuses on understanding and implementing advanced asynchronous features in Python 3.9. The primary learning objectives include mastering asynchronous generators, utilizing asynchronous comprehensions, and correctly applying type annotations to generator functions.

## Core Concepts Covered:

* **Asynchronous Generators:** Learn to write `async def` functions that `yield` values over time, allowing for non-blocking operations using `await`. This enables efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks.
* **Asynchronous Comprehensions:** Explore the use of `async for` within list, set, and dictionary comprehensions to concisely create collections from asynchronous data streams. This builds upon PEP 530.
* **Type-Hinting for Generators:** Understand and implement type annotations for both synchronous (`typing.Generator`) and asynchronous (`typing.AsyncGenerator`) generators, specifying yield, send, and return types where applicable for improved code clarity and robustness.

## Project Requirements & Standards:

* **Environment:** Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* **Coding Style:** Adherence to `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.x).
* **File Standards:**
    * All files must begin with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
    * All files must end with a new line.
* **Documentation:**
    * Comprehensive module-level docstrings (`__doc__`).
    * Detailed function-level docstrings for all functions and coroutines. Docstrings must be descriptive sentences explaining purpose.
* **Type Annotations:** All functions and coroutines must include type hints.
* **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.

This project aims to solidify understanding of asynchronous programming paradigms in Python, emphasizing clean, well-documented, and type-safe code.
