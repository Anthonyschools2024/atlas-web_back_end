Advanced API Pagination Techniques in Python
Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of various API pagination strategies using Python, focusing on efficient and robust data handling. It covers fundamental pagination, the integration of hypermedia (HATEOAS) for enhanced API discoverability, and techniques for ensuring deletion resilience when working with dynamic datasets. The examples are designed to be adaptable, with conceptual use of a dataset like Popular_Baby_Names.csv.
Learning Objectives

This project aims to solidify understanding and practical application of:

    Paginating datasets using simple page and page_size parameters.
    Enriching paginated API responses with hypermedia metadata (HATEOAS links) to improve navigation and API self-description.
    Developing pagination mechanisms that remain consistent and reliable even when data items are deleted.
    Applying Python best practices, including clear documentation (docstrings) and type annotations for robust code.

Key Features & Concepts Demonstrated

    Simple Offset/Page-Based Pagination:
        Implementation of logic to retrieve specific pages of data based on page number and size.
        Functionality to calculate start/end indices for data slicing.

    Hypermedia Pagination (HATEOAS):
        Generation of paginated responses that include navigational links (e.g., first, last, next, prev, self).
        Enhances API discoverability and allows clients to navigate resources dynamically.

    Deletion-Resilient Pagination:
        Strategies to ensure that the requested number of items per page is returned even if underlying data has been removed between requests.
        Involves mechanisms to skip over "gaps" left by deleted items.

    CSV Data Handling:
        Illustrates loading data from CSV files as a common data source for pagination examples.

Technical Stack & Requirements

    Language: Python (version 3.9 or higher is recommended)
    Core Libraries: csv (for CSV manipulation), typing (for type hints like List, Dict, Optional, Any, Tuple).
    Example Dataset: Assumes use of a CSV file (e.g., Popular_Baby_Names.csv) for demonstration purposes.

Code Standards & Practices

    Python Version: All Python scripts should be compatible with Python 3.9+ and start with the shebang #!/usr/bin/env python3.
    File Formatting: All text files, including Python scripts and this README, should end with a new line.
    Code Style: Adherence to pycodestyle (e.g., version 2.5.* or later) for maintaining clean and readable code.
    Documentation (Docstrings):
        Every module, function, and class must include a comprehensive docstring.
        Docstrings should clearly explain the purpose, arguments (including types), return values (including types), and any exceptions raised.
        Example check: python3 -c 'print(__import__("your_module_name").__doc__)'
    Type Annotations:
        All functions and coroutines must be fully type-annotated to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
